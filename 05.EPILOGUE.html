	Prologue - the handout 
<p class="indent"></p>
 Welcome,  
<p class="indent"></p>Currently you find yourself present at the entrance of an academy. This academy is open for interpretation, feedback, flexibility, non-creative and creative activities. It can exist as in several forms at once: a non-place, a space in a space, a timeless moment. Basically, within this academy the space can be everything: the place is a non place, a place in a place, a timeless moment. It can be sacred or unholy. It can be an infinite space and a space of emplacement. The place can travel around, can replace other places, can take as much space needed or can take in every space you ever longed for. The place can be completely full, empty or just a little bit too crowded. You can either feel like you belong here or feel like the mobile structure of the place is too challenging. The place can be real or unreal, safe or unsafe. Nothing is fundamental or fixed here. The only one that can influence this space is you and what you intend to do with it.  
<p class="indent"></p>

Welcome, look around.. How are you feeling here? In your hand, you should find a copy of this handout and a tiny mirror.   We invite you to look in this mirror. While you are holding a mirror, the place you are in could be a mirror as well. It’s a reflection of yourself or of others. It’s a utopia,  a place in which you can position yourself. It could be an unreal, virtual space, that opens up behind the surface; an impossible place, yet you can see yourself there. But you are not there, and your absence from this place invites you to see that where you are not. The mirror is your shadow, your personal view within the space you are in, or at least could be in.   You can choose which mirror to look at..The tiny one you’re holding in your hands, or the bigger one, the one you are now standing in.
