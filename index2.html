It’s a place in which you can position yourself. It could be an unreal, virtual space, that opens up behind the surface; an impossible place, yet you can see yourself there. But you are not there, and your absence from this place invites you to see where you are not. The mirror is your shadow, your personal view within the space you are in, or at least could be in.

			Part one - The department of a playful beginning

			Chapter one - Anni
			<BR>
			<BR>
			As she came out of the toilet she had to climb over a little bench in order to meet John. Obstacles could be found everywhere, the place felt like one big playground. John was waiting for her on the other side of the hallway, on a little bench in the corner. He seemed like a nice guy; very energetic, a bit too much even. He took her hand and dragged her through the hallway. 
			<BR>
			<BR>
			She felt like she just started some sort of game in which they had to see the most places in the least time. John was almost running and hard to keep track off after just arriving at the academy from a long way of travelling. They passed a few doors with signs on them; one said Copy Only, another one Silent Room and another one Place in the… she wasn’t able to read the last sign on the door as they passed. John was so energised; before she knew it they found themselves outside of the building. He pointed to the lake in front of them and told her the floating courtyard could be found in there. The days were short and it was already getting a bit darker which made it too hard to see what John was pointing at. She could vaguely see a round building at the centre of the lake. She had heard about the floating courtyard before, in order to get there, you have to balance over small wooden panels. She didn’t have enough time to figure out more; John wanted to show her some other places on campus. He took her hand and they walked towards a small tipi next to a tree. 
			<BR>
			<BR>
			“This here, this is The Place Where You Can Call Your Mum!”. The tipi was quite small but almost as high as the tree next to it, covering the top of the tipi with its branches. As they walked around it she noticed a small plastic window that gave her a chance to peek inside. In the middle of the tent was a small, red pillow, underneath the stick that supported the tent. She could vaguely see the interior fabric, which seemed to be covered fully with doodles and notes. Next to the pillow laid an iPhone. She walked to the front of the tipi and as she pushed the fabric aside she stepped into it. It smelt like an old dishcloth, she shivered and tried to hold her breath. The doodles on the fabrics were still no easier to read from the inside; the whole tent was covered with small notes layer upon each other. As she took a closer look at the phone next to the pillow she noticed something engraved on it: ‘enchanting ideology’. She wanted to pick the phone up but it seemed to be stuck to the wooden panel. She couldn’t pick it up.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			John entered the tipi behind her and laughed: “Just unlock the phone, it’s glued onto the panels”. Annie pushed the home button and unlocked the iPhone. She saw a white background and two applications: the camera function and its corresponding library. She clicked on the library and opened the album ‘free time’. Photos of people running around in a park, playing with dogs and children, being on holiday, watching a movie with friends or having a barbecue in a garden were displayed. She was confused and tried to find her own answers for the tipi, the doodles, the phone and the pictures. She wondered if she needed an answer and if she did, what kind of question she should ask to get one. “Am I only allowed to call my mum in this place?”, she asked John. He stood up and walked around her and laughed. “You know, he said, while taking her hand to support her getting up, “sometimes you don’t need to be given certain instructions. Think about it! Don’t take it so seriously. Look around, where are you, Anni?” She was still confused, but couldn’t find the right words for it. He didn’t wait for an answer, maybe he didn’t expect to get one, she realised, as he took her hand and dragged her along. Away from the tipi she wanted to explore furthermore.

			Chapter two - John
			<BR>
			<BR>
			John finds himself on the outskirts of the area. He feels tired and looks at his watch, he ran for almost fifty minutes. While catching his breath John looks around and realises that he ran a long way from campus. Instead of going left at the Place Where You Can Call Your Mom Tipi he went right, ran around the floating courtyard and passed the gallery, which he never passes normally. It’s his first time here. It’s the first time, actually, that he sees the border of the campus. It looks rather depressing. John is surrounded by broken containers and some discarded metal sculptures that are piled up next to a tree. He wants to enjoy the view, sit back and listen to the wind passing the forgotten sculptures, but his thoughts are distracting him.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			As he sits down he thinks about Sekula’s class. He looks around. “Maybe Sekula didn’t talk about a factory far away”, he thinks. “Maybe I am the one that’s been asked to make a perfect fabrication.” Now, on the edge of campus, of the so-called ‘no man factory’ Sekula described, he can’t stop thinking about escape. He doesn’t want to be a factory worker. He didn’t come here to become an automatised being. John looks at his hands and with his right thumb, he follows the lines on his left hand. The thick line in the middle, the second from left, slightly curved. He likes the curve, it resembles him. This is the route he wants to follow. This is how his life is going to be. His thumb stops at the end. This is where the route splits, the point where you can go either left or right. Which one should he pick? Where should he go? He only knows he is sure of one thing; these hands are not made to do automatic work with.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			He stands up and walks to the pile with the broken and forgotten sculptures. As he picks up a piece in front of the pile he wonders what it could’ve looked like. It’s unclear what the piece used to be before it was thrown on the pile in front of him. He looks at it for a few minutes, notices the forms creating a human shape as two bent sticks are dangling on a rake in the middle. He recognises human ribs in this rake. Furthermore, he recognises something that might have been an arm. While looking around, he tries to look for answers and if he can possibly find a head laying around, but there’s is no head to be found. He throws the sculpture back on the pile and realises that his imagination can be wrong. The fact that he finds this sculpture, here, thrown on a pile, reminds him that he could’ve been wrong all the time.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			He takes the broken piece with him, sits down on a bent tree and takes the handout, given to him a few years ago, out of his pocket. He wants to reread the handout and notices an underlined sentence: “The mirror is your shadow, your personal view within the space you are in or at least could be in…” When he looks up after reading the handout he sees that it’s getting darker. He takes out his notebook, tries to imagine what the forgotten sculpture in front of him must’ve looked like and starts sketching. Next, he takes out his knife from his small travel bag. He looks around to find a perfect tree to engrave his thoughts in. “I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art”, he engraves. “I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art”, h⁠e keeps engraving the same sentences over and over until it becomes too dark to continue.

			Chapter one - Cedric
			“Is this a lecture or performance?” Nelly asks Cedric. 
			“I think we should just wait for it to end.”, Cedric replies while drinking from his coffee. “When are you going to change your shirt? Nelly added. Cedric was wearing his Goodbye, utopia shirt for over a week now. He mumbled that he would change his shirt if she finally would stop looking at her bellybutton. She recently pierced her belly button just to have a realisesson to look at it. “But you know I want to, it’s cute.” Cedric looks at her while she is trying to look into the tiny mirror which is hanging from her belly button ring. “You’re so weird”, he says.

			They watch Sekula entering the Copy Room walking to the front where he installs himself on a big chair in-between two printers. With both arms he leans on top of them. The two copy machines have a sign on them saying ‘this machine is defect’. 

			“Welcome,” he says. Cedric notices that the room is too packed and unsuited for this many students that came to see the lecture. 
			“I want to tell you something about a factory.”, Sekula continues. 

			“There used to be a factory called the No Men factory. It was located somewhere south of here, some time ago. In this factory people weren’t people, they were machines. They were taught to make something perfect together. Something perfect according to the supervisor. What was this perfect fabrication? Every year the machines made something together they found the most perfect. The supervisor didn’t agree. It was never perfect enough. After five years the unspecified demand of a perfect fabrication was still not delivered. And after ten years of suggesting, trying, adjusting to the supervisor’s demand, nothing even close to perfect was produced.” 

			Sekula interrupts his own story, turns around and starts pressing the print button on the copy machines behind him. First the left one, then the right one. He keeps on repeating this action. The copy machine starts printing something. Cedric can’t figure out what’s being printed. The pages seem almost blank, although it looks like there’s a small text in the corner. As Cedric tries to get a glimpse of what’s on the paper Sekula starts pressing both buttons at the same time now. The copy machine is running high and spitting out papers. 

			“What’s happening?”, Nelly asks Cedric. “I really don’t know.” 

			Sekula seems not to be bothered by wondering faces and ignorantly keeps pushing the buttons of the copy machine in front of him. 

			Nothing happens for a while now. As the printer keeps printing, Cedric and Nelly look at each other confused. Then, suddenly, Sekula turns around and starts screaming at the audience: “WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!”

			No one replies, no one can figure out what is happening. Sekula stops pushing the buttons and with his back still turned to the audience he whispers, ‘everybody should stop copying’, as the printer blows out its last breath.

			Nelly stands up and walks towards Sekula. She takes out the pile of paper from the tray and reads out loud: “Are you serving your own interests?” She chuckles. “Well, are you?” Nelly looks at Sekula while throwing away all the papers from the tray. The papers spread all over the room, falling on people, some even fly out of the windows. Cedric notices that Sekula didn’t expect someone like Nelly to be in the class today. 

			Cedric could feel a tension, a misunderstanding and somehow fear in the copy room. The same room in which he is always just copying something. He never thought the room could be something else. The room shifted, it shifted into becoming the factory Sekula just described.

			People start mumbling and asking each other questions of what just happened. Was this all part of one big lecture? Cedric realises that he is the one that should save Nelly, still standing uncomfortably in front of Sekula, possibly doubting her impulsive action and asks: “Sekula, is this a lecture or a performance?”  

			No one expected him to answer but then he did: “Sometimes, you should find your own answers, think for yourself.” on which Nelly turns around to the class and adds: “Well guys, I think it’s a performance.” She sits down and starts looking at her belly button again. “Or just get a tiny mirror like this one, hanging on your belly button”, she whispers and looks up at Cedric.

			<p>Anni Albers was a textile and printmaker questioning and blurring the lines between traditional arts and craft. Anni studied at the most influential art academies of western history: The Bauhaus (1919) and it focuses on teaching through engagement and understanding of materials and crafts. Followed up by here studies at the Black Mountain College, in North Carolina (1933) questioning its learning process and what an art school or social life rather shouldn’t be. There was no certain answer to it, though to question this, with a set of ideas, could be the answer itself. In the college curriculum, degrees, hierarchy and diploma’s were being questioned. Anni and her husband moved together to the Black Mountain College were Anni continued her abstract weavings. In 1941, Anni wrote a text in which she argued that art should have a ‘playful beginning, unresponsive to any demand of usefulness, an enjoyment of colours, forms and surface contrasts and harmonies – a tactile sensuousness’.

			<p>John Baldessari is known for his conceptual art. He works with pre-existing images, distorts them, collaging or cropping, blocking out faces with coloured dots; all to question what an image actually is. Once, John wasn’t able to travel to his class in the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Canada because there wasn’t enough money. He proposed to the students to write “I’ll Not Make Any More Boring Art’ on the walls of the gallery. Imitating punishment in schools by writing down the same sentence over and over again to realize your mistake. Giving instructions to students from far away, not able to be present, he enables the situation to raise questions about the role of the artists, autonomy, and authorship but also the role of a teacher.
			<BR>

			In his essay about heterotopias, about the other space, Foucault talks about a ship. Floating on the sea constantly moving and changing locations. The ship, a reference to connect, trade and globalisation can also be an embodiment of our student position: we experience this exchange, the internationality and moving structure. The structure in which we study characterises the standardisation we experience. For example, in 1999 the Bologna Declaration was signed and consisted of how we know the education system now: three cycles of higher-education qualifications within a basic framework of ECTS credit points. This enabled, among positive effects like the introduction of being able to do internships or exchanges to other schools (like Erasmus Scholarships), the more questionable system of the ECTS' credit points. Higher education in Europe was, from then on, valued by a system consisting of these ECTS' credit points.
